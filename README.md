# Maruq

**The modern, accessible replacement for `<marquee>`.**

It is designed as a modern alternative to the deprecated HTML `<marquee>` tag,
built for today’s web and modern frameworks.

## Features

- Accessible by default
- Respects reduced motion preferences
- Framework-friendly (React, Vue, Svelte)

- No deprecated or unsafe behavior

## Project Status
